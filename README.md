# Violin-Fingering-Generation-Through-Audio-Symbolic-Fusion

## YTVF Dataset
The dataset consists of 30 different performance recordings which can be viewed on YouTube. The fingerings are manually annotated by carefully watching the video and identifying the fingers visually. The annotations involve performance attributes of each note, including pitch, bar, onset(start), duration, string, hand position, finger choice, bowing, and whether the note is harmonic.

The 30 violin pieces and their YouTube links are:

| Song Name   | Composer | Performer | YouTube Link |
